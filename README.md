# Elixir cards dojo

## What

We're going to be solving a card problem in Elixir.
You will need to have Elixir installed, or pair with someone who does.

**Given five playing cards, evaluate the hand.**

Have a quick look at the [possible hands](cards-hands.md) we'll be identifying.

## How

* Find a pairing partner
* `git clone` this repo
* `cd elixir-dojo`
* Run the tests (`mix test`)
* Fix the failing tests by adding to [`hand.ex`](/lib/dojo/hand.ex)
* Add [tests](/test/dojo) where relevant (the provided tests are not sufficient)
* Open a Pull Request so we can discuss different approaches

## Why

Level up your elixir skills!
